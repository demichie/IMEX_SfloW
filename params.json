  "body": "### Welcome to IMEX_SfloW.\r\n\r\nIMEX_SfloW is a FORTRAN90 code designed to solve the shallow water equations, written as a hyperbolic system of partial differential equations with relaxation and source terms. \r\nThe model is discretized in time with an explicit-implicit Runge-Kutta method where the hyperbolic part is solved explicetely and the other terms (relaxation and surce) are treated implicitely.\r\nThe finite volume solver for the hyperbolic part of the system is based on a semidiscrete central scheme and it is not tied on the specific eigenstructure of the model.\r\nThe implicit part is solved with a Newton-Raphson method where the elements of the Jacobian of the nonlinear system are evaluated numerically with a complex step derivative technique.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nMattia de' Michieli Vitturi (@demichie)\r\n\r\nGiacomo Lari\r\n\r\n### Installation and execution\r\n\r\nCheck first if you have the LAPACK library installed on your system.\r\n\r\nDownload the IMEX_SfloW package and create the executable with the following commands from a terminal:\r\n\r\n./configure\r\n\r\nmake\r\n\r\nmake install\r\n\r\n\r\nThis will create the executable in the bin folder. You can test the executable copying it in the EXAMPLES folder and running it. The output can be plotted with the script plot_p.m provided in the MATLAB folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nDoxygen generated documentation can be found at <http://demichie.github.io/IMEX_SfloW/html/>\r\n\r\n\r\n### References\r\nM. deâ€™ Michieli Vitturi, 2016.",
